The fact that we had to do the whole procedure of an ML project made the challenge really
interesting. As a team, we had already had participated in challenges where the data were
handed to us, so the fact that we had to do the collection of data ourselves made it much
more interesting as it made the challenge complete.

The sensor was really easy to work with and we had no trouble collecting the data. Having
said that, we faced a lot of trouble setting up the environment to collect them.

The Linux drivers that recognise the devices ended up being problematic (even though
the device was successfully connected, the drivers could not detect it and find the
devices device_id) and due to the fact that we had no Windows PC available as a team, 
we ended up losing a lot of time trying to find out what was wrong. As a result, 
setting up the environment gave us a lot of trouble, but it all turned out great when 
we created a Windows virtual machine.

One thing that we will definitely do different next time is that we will strive to 
make a working model faster so that we can test the hyperparameters and the data 
collection techniques a lot more. Also, next time we will definitely make sure to 
bring Windows PCs!
